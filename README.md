# Senate-Runoffs-Strategy-Parser
The Senate County Voter Analysis Tool pulls the data from the general Senate races in every county across Georgia from the New York Times website and stores it in an Excel file with analysis of correlations between demographic trends and voter alignment. This way, we could figure out which counties to target to help Ossoff and Warnock win the January 2021 runoffs.
